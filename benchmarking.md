## Benchmarking     

### How can we do some benchmarking here?                        
1. Generate randomized data for various board sizes and compare time in seconds / milli-seconds.                  
2. We can compare Python vs C++ speed.                      
3. In C++ land, we can compile with optimization O3, O8 etc for example, and compare results.    
4. If we have multiple devices (or) AWS instances, we can also benchmark against RAM available, processor speed etc.
