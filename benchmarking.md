## Benchmarking     

### How can we do some benchmarking here?                        
1. Generate randomized data for various board sizes and compare time in seconds / milli-seconds.                  
2. We can compare Python vs C++ speed.                      
3. In C++ land, we can compile with optimization O3, O8 etc for example, and compare results.
