#### Overview of the general implementation

From what I understand from the question - we have to implement API's with defined function signatures. And, these API's will be run against a test harness.             

Solution Steps Overview:                
1. Implement the solution.            
2. Compile and Run      
3. Create a static (or) shared library that the test-harness can use for various board sizes              
   This can also be used by other interested programs, kinda serves like an SDK.      
4. Run some tests against the solution, benchmarking.
